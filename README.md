Hi Jay,


Please finish below coding task, push it to GIT and give me the URL.

Build a web page that displays latest public images from flickr using below API:

For each photo, display the author name beside the photo and link it to a page that shows photos uploaded by the author. This page(containing photos uploaded by author) should contain a link to another page that shows public photos uploaded by author's friends

Feed -> Photos uploaded by author -> Photos uploaded by friends & contacts

APIs to use

Regards,
Satya
